## Welcome!

Hi! I'm Kyle Chambers from Whippany, NJ. My background is in information technology and management, and I've worked in several different areas in the industry, from Information Security to UI development.

I'm amazed by the way data influences critical decision making and strive to learn more about how I could use programming to make positive impacts in my field.

This is a powerful engine that drives businesses to their full potential. Without correctly visualizing and analyzing your company’s data, you could be holding back that potential. I currently work as a Data Analyst/Developer where I am learning new technology every day. Let’s collaborate!
